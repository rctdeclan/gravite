Gravité is made by 5 students from Fontys University.
This is our project for the first term.

Gravité is a 3D platformer game in which you control a ball and try to get it through the level. We also created a special input controller using Lego NXT and a Hitechnic Accelerometer sensor.

We were inspired by the game Ballance, and we tried to mimic it and add some cool things.

For some livestream videos of us demonstrating both Gravité and the controller, go here:
